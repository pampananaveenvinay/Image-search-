 ## Image Search App

This is a simple image search app that allows users to search for images on Unsplash. The app is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### Getting Started

To get started, clone the repository and install the dependencies.

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-search-app.git
cd image-search-app
npm install
```

### Running the App

To run the app, start the development server.

```
npm start
```

The app will be available at http://localhost:3000.

### Code Overview

The app consists of three main files:

* `index.html`: The HTML file that defines the structure of the app.
* `imagestyle.css`: The CSS file that styles the app.
* `imagescript.js`: The JavaScript file that implements the app's functionality.

#### index.html

The `index.html` file defines the structure of the app. It includes the HTML code for the header, navigation bar, search form, and search results.

The header contains the app's title. The navigation bar contains a link to the home page. The search form allows users to enter a search term. The search results section displays the images that match the search term.

#### imagestyle.css

The `imagestyle.css` file styles the app. It defines the colors, fonts, and layout of the app.

#### imagescript.js

The `imagescript.js` file implements the app's functionality. It handles the search form submission and displays the search results.

The search form submission is handled by the `handleSubmit` function. The `handleSubmit` function takes the search term from the search form and sends it to the Unsplash API. The Unsplash API returns a list of images that match the search term. The `handleSubmit` function then displays the images in the search results section.

### Conclusion

This is a simple image search app that demonstrates how to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build a web application. The app is easy to use and can be customized to meet your needs.
